## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/omi-memory-keeper.git
   cd omi-memory-keeper
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   - Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
   - Navigate to the `client` folder and install the necessary packages:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

4. Set up PostgreSQL:
   - Install and configure PostgreSQL, then create a database called `omi_memory_keeper`.
   - Run the database migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py db upgrade
     ```

5. Configure your environment variables (e.g., for Omi API, Google Cloud credentials, etc.).

6. Run the app:
   - Start the backend:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Start the frontend:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Sample Code

Here is a sample of how we use the **Google Natural Language API** to analyze sentiment from transcribed conversations and determine the user's emotional state:

### Python (Backend) - Sentiment Analysis

```python
from google.cloud import language_v1
from google.cloud.language_v1 import enums

def analyze_sentiment(text):
    client = language_v1.LanguageServiceClient()

    document = language_v1.Document(content=text, type_=enums.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT)
    sentiment = client.analyze_sentiment(request={'document': document}).document_sentiment

    return sentiment.score, sentiment.magnitude

# Example usage:
text = "I am feeling really happy today, everything seems to be going well."
score, magnitude = analyze_sentiment(text)
print(f"Sentiment Score: {score}, Magnitude: {magnitude}")
```

This function uses the Google Cloud Natural Language API to analyze the sentiment of a given text. The score indicates whether the sentiment is positive or negative, and the magnitude shows the strength of the sentiment.

### React (Frontend) - Displaying Emotional Insights

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const EmotionDashboard = () => {
  const [emotionData, setEmotionData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/emotion-data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setEmotionData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="emotion-dashboard">
      <h1>Emotional Insights</h1>
      <ul>
        {emotionData.map((entry, index) => (
          <li key={index}>
            <strong>{entry.date}:</strong> {entry.emotion} (Strength: {entry.magnitude})
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EmotionDashboard;
```

This simple React component fetches emotional insights from the backend and displays them on the userâ€™s dashboard. It shows the emotions and their associated strength (magnitude) based on the conversation logs.

## Challenges
- **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**: Ensuring that the AI correctly identifies emotions in nuanced conversations.
- **User Privacy**: Implementing strict data privacy measures to ensure that users' conversations and personal data are kept secure.
- **Real-Time Transcription**: Handling large volumes of transcription data and processing them efficiently.

---

## Accomplishments
- Successfully integrated Omi's real-time transcription feature to automatically log memories.
- Created a seamless UI that allows users to track emotions, view past memories, and gain personal insights.
- Developed a sentiment analysis engine capable of detecting emotional shifts in user conversations.

---

## What We Learned
- The importance of building a strong AI model for accurate sentiment analysis in real-world scenarios.
- How to manage and display large datasets (e.g., emotion tracking and memory logs) in a user-friendly way.
- User feedback is crucial for shaping features like memory summarization and emotional tracking.

---

## What's Next
- **Expanded AI Insights**: We plan to develop more advanced AI-driven recommendations for personal growth and mental well-being.
- **Memory Sharing**: Add features to share memories or emotional insights with close friends or family in a private and meaningful way.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app to make it easier for users to access and interact with their memories and emotional data on the go.
